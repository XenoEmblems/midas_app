Did I mention that I am a recent graduate of a Web Development Intensive entering the market as a junior developer in New York City?-	As a user, I would like access to aggregated data that makes me feel as though I have arrived at “one stop shop,” tailored specifically to my needs.-	As a user, I would like these services delivered to me in a platform that is intuitive and enjoyable.Dev stories-	As a dev, I would like to learn to seamlessly incorporate data from multiple API’s, maximizing the quality and quantity of data available to me.-	As a dev, I would like to learn how to “sift” through this data, extracting the essentials to be used as needed. I would like to limit these results to optimize the performance of my app.-	As a dev, I would like learn to collaborate within a small team of other devs, working together to overcome the many challenges that one faces in this process.-	As a dev, I would like to see an app through from its conception to production.-	As a dev, I would like to increase my comfort and understanding in using Git and Heroku.-	As a dev, I would like to become re-acquainted with Backbone.js and other client-side/front-end technologies that I learned earlier in the course.API’sThe following APIs were utilized:       ☻ Indeed (http://www.indeed.com/jsp/apiinfo.jsp)       ☻ Glassdoor (http://www.glassdoor.com/api/index.htm)       ☻ theMuse.com (https://www.themuse.com/developers - job-listing)       ☻ Craigslist (http://www.craigslist.org/about/bulk_posting_interface)Limitations and utility of the APIs:-	Glassdoor would only provide an API key upon proof of a certain volume of traffic--proof that Team Midas could not, at this time, provide.-	Glassdoor DID provide employer rating and salary range data (low, median, high) that are displayed their individual modals as optional information for the user to peruse at their desire/convenience-	theMuse.com, a site that was previously unknown to Team Midas, provided lofty stylistic goals and, secondarily, a solid chunk of user data with a very limited search criteria-	Craigslist and Indeed APIs provided developers with more thorough and more plentiful data in XML that was parsed into JSON and combined with what was previously-obtained to form a MONSTER mass of data-	Craigslist’s API unfortunately detects and responds negatively to any interaction with Heroku, which eradicates use of that data (for beta v0.1.1)-	Reinforced the importance of good documentation.Walk-through-	upon landing on the page, the user is prompted to input her first and last name-	that input is then prepended to the top of the page, revealing a clean interface that has the appearance of a résumé-	 in the ‘Job Opportunities’ section of the résumé, the user has the option to show all jobs available in the database at that time, or to search for 6 previously configured searches: javascript, ruby, git, node, backbone, and front-end-	When the user is interested in additional information, clicking on an individual job posting will render the full job post view-	If the user is intrigued to do so, there is the option to click on the employer or job title for information from Glassdoor on employer ratings and salary ranges, respectively
